## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a backend developer focused on designing and building well-structured, maintainable APIs using NestJS. This repository showcases my practice projects and experiments as I sharpen my skills in API architecture, documentation, and backend development best practices.

NestJS has become one of my go-to frameworks for creating scalable and modular server-side applications. Its support for TypeScript, dependency injection, and a clean architectural style makes it ideal for writing readable, testable code. Iâ€™m exploring how to break projects into meaningful modules, manage services and controllers, and handle data validation and exception filters effectively.

To complement the development process, Iâ€™m also learning how to use Swagger (OpenAPI) for documenting APIs in a clear and developer-friendly way. Swagger helps make my endpoints discoverable, testable, and easier for others to integrate with. I'm using tools like @nestjs/swagger to automatically generate interactive documentation and keep it in sync with the codebase.

This repository includes working API projects that demonstrate RESTful design principles, versioning, request validation, error handling, and integration with databases and authentication systems. Each project is structured to be understandable and extendableâ€”ideal for anyone learning NestJS or looking to build production-ready APIs.

As I grow, Iâ€™m also exploring testing strategies, middleware patterns, and how to build APIs that are robust, secure, and future-proof.

If youâ€™re interested in NestJS, API design, or backend architecture, feel free to explore the projects, fork the code, or share your feedback. Iâ€™m always eager to learn from the community and collaborate with other developers.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”and hereâ€™s to building better APIs, one endpoint at a time.
